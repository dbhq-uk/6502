title: "Planning the NES"
date: 2026-10-05
summary: "The third machine is the NES, in both its NTSC and PAL forms. Before any of its code, six fact sheets were written from the nesdev wiki, and every number the plan had written from memory was checked against them. Most held. The PAL frame counter's last step was one cycle out, the DMA cycle counts were stated too simply, the test ROM signature could not be confirmed, and the PPU test ROM the plan meant to run first turned out to need a mapper that arrives six tasks later. The project, its test project and the test ROM pins went in with the sheets."

# 5 October 2026: planning the NES

The design was settled today, in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-nes-design.md`, and the plan is
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-nes.md`. This entry records what task 1 of
the plan found and did: six fact sheets in `docs/nes/facts/`, the corrections
they made to the plan, and the first code, which is the project, its test
project and the pins for the test ROMs.

## Two decisions from the design

The design's table has six decisions. Two of them changed the shape of the work
after the first draft, and both are Dan's calls of 5 October.

- **PAL is in this machine, with NTSC.** It was chosen over NTSC only. The PAL
  console is a different timing, not a different machine: its PPU runs 3.2 dots
  for every CPU cycle rather than 3, its frame is 312 lines rather than 262, and
  its sound unit has its own tables. So the bus's tick is a ratio per region and
  not a fixed three, and a `Region` value holds every number that differs, so no
  chip tests for a region by name. Every test that touches timing runs for both.
- **The 3D models are in scope, but are their own project.** They were chosen
  over putting the models in this design, and over leaving them out. The BBC
  Micro's models were their own design and plan, and Dan ruled on 2 October that
  models never hold up a count. The NES is cased, so it gets two models or none,
  built by another agent in a second pull request.

## The plan's form, and why

The plan has sixteen tasks, one commit each, on the branch `implement-nes`. Like
the BBC Micro's, and unlike the core's, it does not carry the code. The PPU and
the sound unit are thousands of lines, and writing them into a document that
nothing has run would be a guess at the code rather than a plan for it. So each
task gives its interfaces, the facts it is built from and the exact test
assertions, a fresh agent writes the tests first and the code to pass them, and
a reviewer gates each task before the next starts.

What is proven early is the risky part. Task 3 runs `nestest` through the real
bus, and its log also checks the PPU's dot counter. Task 6 measures the speed in
a browser before the sound and the mappers exist, because a PPU stepped one dot
at a time inside every CPU cycle is about 5.4 million dots a second and the
browser has to keep up. A draft pull request opens after this task so that CI
runs on every push.

## The fact sheets

The chips are written from the nesdev wiki through the sheets, never from
another emulator's code: Mesen, FCEUX and Nestopia are GPL and this repository is
MIT. Six sheets came first: timing, the bus, the PPU, the sound unit, the
mappers and the cartridge file. Every statement names the wiki page it comes
from, anything not settled is marked `[guessing - verify]`, and each behaviour
has a worked example a test can be taken from.

**How the wiki was read.** The wiki refuses automated fetches with a Cloudflare
challenge, and a browser was blocked too. So each page was read from its newest
copy in the Internet Archive that held the page rather than the challenge. Each
copy names the wiki revision it is, and the sheets' README lists them, so the
exact text can be opened again. The Archive went offline for part of the
afternoon, which delayed two pages (the noise channel and the sweep) but lost
none.

## What the sheets changed in the plan

The plan's list of "facts every task relies on" was written from memory and
marked as a guess. Each item was checked against its page. These held: the
clocks, the frame sizes, the VBlank lines, the NTSC frame counter, the noise
periods and the DMC rates in both regions, and the PPU's position at reset as
`nestest.log` shows it. These did not, and the list now says so in place:

- **The PAL frame counter's last step was one cycle late.** Memory had 33253 to
  33255 CPU cycles; the wiki gives the step in APU cycles, 16626 and 16627, which
  is 33252 to 33254. The NTSC figures converted the same way match what memory
  had, which is the check that the conversion is right.
- **OAM DMA's extra cycle is not about odd cycles as such.** It is 514 cycles
  when the halt falls on a "get" half of the APU's clock and 513 otherwise, and
  which CPU cycles are gets is random at power-on. "Odd cycles cost one more" is
  one of the two consoles, so it stays as the model's choice and is written down
  as one.
- **DMC DMA does not simply steal "up to 4" cycles.** The first fetch after
  enabling normally takes 3, later ones 4, a fetch inside OAM DMA 2, and one at
  its very end 1 or 3; a CPU write delays it.
- **The test ROM signature could not be confirmed.** The readme in the fork
  writes the bytes at `$6001` to `$6003` as `$DE $B0 $G1`, and `$G1` is not
  hexadecimal. Memory had `61`. Task 4 reads the real bytes from a running ROM.
- **The PPU test ROM needs a mapper that comes six tasks later.** The combined
  `ppu_vbl_nmi.nes` is an MMC1 cartridge (256 KB of program, mapper 1), and MMC1
  is task 10, but task 4 runs it. Its ten single tests are plain NROM
  cartridges, so task 4 now pins and runs those, and the combined ROM moves to
  task 12, after MMC1. It is still pinned here, as this task's ruling asked.
- **Two test ROM folders the design names are not in the fork.** There is no
  `ppu_sprite_hit` or `ppu_sprite_overflow`; the older
  `sprite_hit_tests_2005.10.05` and `sprite_overflow_tests` are there, and the
  plan already uses those. `mmc3_test_2` has only single tests.

Two further findings are for later tasks rather than corrections:

- **The PAL picture is not 8:7.** The design gives the screen an 8:7 pixel shape
  for 4:3. That is NTSC's; the wiki gives the PAL pixel as about 1.386 to 1
  (Overscan page). Task 14 decides whether the page shows PAL at its own shape.
- **The PAL PPU blanks part of the picture.** The 2C07 draws a black border over
  the top line and two pixels at each side, which the NTSC PPU does not.

The plan's task 14 now shows the picture in each region's own pixel shape, 8:7
on NTSC and about 1.386:1 on PAL, and tests it.

## The PAL dot ratio

The PAL PPU runs 3.2 dots for each CPU cycle, which is 16 dots in every 5
cycles. The wiki gives the ratio but not which of the five cycles gets the
fourth dot. It follows from the two clock dividers: the CPU takes 16 master
clocks a cycle and the PPU 5 a dot, so in 80 master clocks there are 5 cycles and
16 dots, and if a cycle and a dot start together the cycles complete 3, 3, 3, 3
and then 4 dots. Another starting phase moves the 4, and there is always exactly
one. A whole-number accumulator that adds 16 each cycle and runs a dot for every
5 gives the same pattern from zero. Which phase a real console powers up in is
not known, so the model's choice will go in `docs/known-differences.md` when task
3 makes it.

## Task 1

The task added `src/Dbhq.Machines.Nes/`, an empty library on the core, and
`tests/Dbhq.Machines.Nes.Tests/`, both in the solution. The test ROMs are not
committed (AGENTS.md rule 3): `NesTestRoms.Read` fetches a file from the fork
`dbhq-uk/nes-test-roms` at a pinned commit, the same commit `nestest` already
came from, and checks it against its SHA-256 in `Pins.NesTestRomHashes`, which is
keyed by the file's path in the fork. Two are pinned: `other/nestest.nes`, whose
hash is the existing `NestestRomSha256` so the two can never disagree, and
`ppu_vbl_nmi/ppu_vbl_nmi.nes`, hashed with `sha256sum` on a fresh download.

The test was written first and failed to compile, because neither `NesTestRoms`
nor the pins existed. It checks that every pinned file matches its hash and
starts with the iNES magic `4E 45 53 1A`, that both ROMs tasks 3 and 4 need are
pinned, that nestest has one hash and not two, and that a name that is not
pinned is refused. Changing one character of the PPU ROM's pin made the test
fail with the download's hash mismatch, which is the check that the test reads
the pin.

## Mistakes

The review of this task found two worked examples in `ppu.md` that a test would
have been wrong to copy. One gave the pattern fetch addresses for `v` = `$2000`
as if fine Y were 0, but in the rendering layout `$2000` is fine Y = 2, so the
addresses were 2 too low; it now uses `v` = `$0000` and shows both. The other
said a sprite at X = 4 with the left columns hidden makes no hit, but an 8-pixel
sprite there reaches column 11, so the hit comes at column 8. Both were worked
by eye from the rules rather than computed from the bit layout. Every worked
example in the sheet was then recomputed from the layout, and the rest held.
